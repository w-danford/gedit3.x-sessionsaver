# gedit3.x-sessionsaver
A Session Saver for gedit 3.x
I created this running gedit 3.18.3 under Ubuntu 16.04. So likely it is compatable with gedit 3.x, no guarantees though. It is self-contained as a single Python3 file, and of course the .plugin file.
Just save the two files under your home directory at &quot;.local/share/gedit/plugins/&quot;
